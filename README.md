## :book: Learnings

I originally started this project a couple years ago. It was something I dusted off and continued. The main purpose of this project was to learn while building something valuable for users, and I especially enjoyed learning about:
| Concept | Learnings |
|:---|:---|
| Refactoring | The old Pastapaste used class-based React, and I wanted to learn modern React. A big part was also reading old code from two years ago, and since I had grown as a better developer since then I felt like I was reading someone else's code. It was a rewarding experience to learn how to a.) understand the thought process by reading code and b.) implementing improvements I saw fit!|
| Chrome API | Since I developed a Chrome extension, I learned about and used the [Chrome API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api). I especially enjoyed learning about `storage.sync`, allowing users to sync data across browsers.|
| NextJS | This wasn't my first time developing in NextJS, but it had been my first time in a while so it was rewarding to get back into the groove and bolstering my front-end skills!|

## :city_sunrise: Future Features + Considerations
[Aug 12]: Filter options (e.g. Sort by oldest, newest, alphabetical, etc.) to give the most options for the user to see their options
[Aug 12]: Tags/Folders to group pieces of text together. For example:
1. `Career`: One folder for all your job searching text pieces. Maybe you see yourself writing the same description about your most recent job?
2. `Twitch`: Funny copypasta messages in Twitch chat you'd like to have ready for you to spam.
3. `Links`: Links you send all the time. Maybe a Zoom link invitation you send to everyone, or your Portfolio/Github/Linkedin URL to keep handy?

I also wanted to give credit to this [Github repo](https://github.com/pondorasti/nextjs-chrome-extension) which I forked from to get started!
